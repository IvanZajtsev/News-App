# News-App
My first app working with API and UserDefaults

You can choose language (russian or english) and choose subject of articles.

Then you can go to site where information was taken from.

Visits of each article are counted.

I was using newsapi.org to get news. All articles are saved in UserDefaults, so you can close app, then open and see some previous articles even without internet connection.
